# üöó Automobile Use Case Using Minifabric üöó

Welcome to the **Automobile Lifecycle Management System**! This project demonstrates the tracking of **automobile manufacturing**, **ownership**, and **lifecycle status** using **Hyperledger Fabric** and **Minifabric**. With this system, you can ensure transparency and security in automobile tracking using blockchain technology.

## üîç Overview

This project leverages **Minifabric** to simplify the deployment and management of a **Hyperledger Fabric** network. It includes a **smart contract** that handles **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing car assets in the system.

The main objective of this system is to provide a decentralized, secure, and transparent platform for managing automobile lifecycle events.

## üåü Features

- **Asset Lifecycle Management**: Track the lifecycle of automobiles from manufacturing to ownership and status updates in real-time.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete car records with secure blockchain transactions.
- **Security & Privacy**: Strict access control using **MSP (Membership Service Providers)** to ensure only authorized users interact with the blockchain.
- **Channel-based Communication**: Enable secure communication among various participants (manufacturer, dealer, customer, etc.) via Hyperledger Fabric channels.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before setting up this project:

- [Minifabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/minifabric) ‚Äì For quick deployment of Hyperledger Fabric networks
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) ‚Äì For running the network containers
- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) ‚Äì For writing and running smart contracts
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) ‚Äì For any frontend or additional integration needs
- [Hyperledger Fabric CLI Tools](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) ‚Äì For interacting with the Fabric network

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Minifabric network and deploy the automobile use case smart contract.

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repository/automobile-usecase.git
    cd automobile-usecase
    ```

2. **Install Minifabric**:

    Follow the [Minifabric installation guide](https://github.com/hyperledger/minifabric#installation) to install Minifabric on your machine.

3. **Start the Fabric Network**:

    Use Minifabric to deploy the Hyperledger Fabric network.

    ```bash
    minifab netup -s couchdb -e true -i 2.4.8 -o manufacturer.auto.com
    ```

    This command starts the network with CouchDB as the state database and Fabric version 2.4.8.

4. **Create the Channel**:

    After the network is up, create a channel for communication between network participants.

    ```bash
    minifab create -c autochannel
    ```

5. **Join Peers to the Channel**:

    Join all peers to the channel.

    ```bash
    minifab join -c autochannel
    ```

6. **Anchor Peer Update**:

    Update the anchor peer for the channel.

    ```bash
    minifab anchorupdate
    ```

7. **Profile Generation**:

    Generate the network profile for further interaction with the network.

    ```bash
    minifab profilegen -c autochannel
    ```

## Network Configuration

This setup utilizes **Minifabric** to create the following network components:

- **Peers**: 
  - `peer1.org0.example.com`
  - `peer2.org0.example.com`
  - `peer1.org1.example.com`
  - `peer2.org1.example.com`

- **Orderers**: 
  - `orderer1.example.com`
  - `orderer2.example.com`
  - `orderer3.example.com`

- **CA (Certificate Authorities)**: 
  - `ca1.org0.example.com`
  - `ca1.org1.example.com`

The **autochannel** is created for secure communication among participants in the network.
